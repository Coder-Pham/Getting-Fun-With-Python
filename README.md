# About the project
I just want to do some small tools to make my life better (maybe someone else too).

# Prerequisites
To run this quickstart, youâ€™ll need:
+ Python 3.6.5 or greater.    
+ The pip package management tool (Anaconda is better).     
+ A good knowlegde about Powershell or Bash.  

# How I set up my programming environment.
## Visual Studio Code

### Settings
This settings is for VSCode, some paths are needed to check because of difference in version.

      "label": "Git bash"
    },
  ],
  "java.home": "C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_181",
}
```

## Environment variables path
### Java
Create 2 more system variables:
```
JAVA_HOME: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_181
JRE_HOME: C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_181
```

Add this to Path:
```
PATH: C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_181
```

### Python (Anaconda)
When installed Anaconda, everything will be updated in Environment variables, so don't need to worry about it.

### C++ (MinGW)
Add this to Path in System variables:
```
PATH: C:\MinGW\bin
```

### LaTeX (MikTex)
Install only MikTex to compile .tex file
Add this to user variables PATH:
```
PATH: C:\Users\DELL\AppData\Local\Programs\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\x64\
```
But sometimes, it will be automatically added in.

## C++
Install MinGW with basic packages.
When need to compile .cpp and debug it, I use vs-support.py with well-fixed .json which I had uploaded to GitHub.

## Python
I use Miniconda 3 as my package management which very handul. But remember `conda update conda python` after install.
There are 3 must-have packages I installed in every environments:
  + pylint
  + autopep8 (channel **conda-forge**)
  + ipython

There are some environments I'm working on it:
  + **IMG_VID**: *pillow* and *opencv2*
  + **WEB_TEST**: *selenium*
  + **WEB**: *Django*
  + **CRAWL**: *BeautifulSoup4*, *requests* and *PyQT*

## Java
I only use Java in few months maybe (hope so) because this is in my curriculum.
I just install Java Development Kit SE 8. And that's it, nothing more.

## LaTeX
Basically, I just install MikTex and when writing report, if I need any packages, I install it. There is no configuration I made for LaTeX.

## Bash on Ubuntu on Windows (WSL)
I installed Bash from Windows Store and look up on the internet to download **oh my zsh**.
*robbyrussell* theme is pretty perfect for me. Simple and clean.
**NOTE**:  Remember to install *DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline* font, because Windows always miss that for Bash.

## Git
Just install it, I don't use Git Bash much. It just support for *Source Control* in Visual Studio Code.

## Evernote:
This is a quite handy application for taking note. I have a lot of lesson and technique in programming so it helps me keep things clean and organize.
